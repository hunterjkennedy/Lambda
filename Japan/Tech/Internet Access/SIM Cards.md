SIM cards allow existing phones to be connected to the internet and send texts or make phone calls. They are an option for [[Internet Access]] and an alternative to [[Pocket Wi-Fi]].

## Physical SIM Cards
---
There are lots of [options](https://tokyocheapo.com/business/internet/prepaid-cheap-japan-sim-card-options/). The best seems to be from [mobal](https://www.mobal.com/japan-sim-card/). Currently, they have a 30 day Unlimited talk/text/data (with ~7GB high speed) for 7500 Yen (~$54).

## eSIMs
---
eSIMs are rather new. [airalo](https://www.airalo.com/japan-esim) offers 15-day plans with 2GB of data for $6.50. No talk or text.

## Perks
---
SIM cards would give you internet access without carrying around another device or charger. They can give you internet access, as well as text and call support.

## Limitations
---
SIM cards cannot be used if your phone is carrier-locked. AT&T and Verizon will generally carrier-lock you unless the phone has been fully paid off *and* you have called to request unlocking.
