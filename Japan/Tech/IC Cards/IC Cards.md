## Types of Cards
---
There are 10 major IC cards. They have mostly equivalent compatability. The biggest are [[Suica]] and [[PASMO]] cards. 

## Which Card to Get
---
[[Suica]] or [[PASMO]], though it does not really matter. They all work with the IC network for the most part. *Some* transit-specific cards cannot be used outside of the network.

## Where to Acquire
---
IC Cards can be purchased at automated machines throughout Japan. However, the card style you get depends on which machine you buy it from. [[JR]] operated machines in the Tokyo region dispense [[Suica]] cards, and non-JR operated machines in the Tokyo region dispense [[PASMO]] cards.

## Where to Return Cards
---
IC Cards can be returned _ONLY_ in the region you purchased it from. Or you can keep it as a souvenier.

## Where to Load
---
You can load the cards at IC Ticket machines or some ATMs (including [[7-11]] ATMs). They are **cash only**.

## Where to Use
---
The IC Card can be used anywhere you see the following logo:
