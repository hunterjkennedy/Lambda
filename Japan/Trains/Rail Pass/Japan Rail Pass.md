The Japan Rail Pass is a joint agreement between 6 rail operators. They can be purchased from a number of retailers. ^ab276f

## Cost
---
The rail pass costs about $350 for regular tickets and $469 for Green passes.

## Green Pass
---
The Green pass is basically US airlines' "First Class", i.e. a little more leg room and bigger windows, less crowding, and shorter lines.

## Where to Buy
---
The JRP can be purchased from a number of retailers online. The best is probably [this](https://www.japanrailpass-reservation.net/) site, the Official site of the Japan Rail Pass Group.
The pass can also be purchased in Japan until March 31st 2024, but there is no guarantee on rates.

## How to Acquire
---
If purchased through the official site, the ticket can be picked up at "the" ticket counter in the airport. Some places may ship you a voucher. Must present identification to pickup.

## Perks
---
You can make free seat reservations on JRP eligible trains. Seat reservations are not necessary, but may be nice for high-crowd times of year.

## Limitations
---
There are a number of [limitations](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html) to the pass. The fastest of the [[Shinkansen]] between Tokyo and Kyoto, the [[Nozomi]], is not covered by the JRP. Nozomi runs on the [[Tokaido Line]]. The fastest of the Sanyo/Kyushu routes, the Mizuho, are also not covered. For both of these lines, other Shinkansen are available, though run less frequently and travel slower.
