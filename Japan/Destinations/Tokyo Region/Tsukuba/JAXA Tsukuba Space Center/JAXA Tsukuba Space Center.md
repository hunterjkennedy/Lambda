The JAXA Tsukuba Space Center the actual space center of JAXA. This is a research facility, so the displays seem rather limited.

## Access
---
The space center can be reached via metro from [[Shunjuki Station]] and a short bus ride once in [[Tsukuba]].

## Exhibits
---
See the [pamphlet](jaxaTsukubaSpaceCenterPamphlet.pdf) for more information. An [H-II](JAXA Tsukuba Space Center#H-II) orbital launch vehicle is on display in the center of the park. In the Space Dome (interior), exhibits are shown of satellites, development, and other scientific modules.
