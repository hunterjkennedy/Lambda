I made Lambda its own directory so that [[Benjamin Coffman]] and I can work on this Vault together.
I am adding that I want to go to the [[JAXA Tsukuba Space Center]]. That would be amazing. There may be other things to do in [[Tsukuba]] so I will add entries for both of those locations.

#TODO I want to make some templates for types of entries. Particularly, I would like to add one for Destinations. This will include headers and a table template.
Destinations should have at least:
- What is it
- Where is it
- How can you get there
- How much does it cost
- What can you do there
- Pictures
- Other information


#TODO Add a template for Hotels
